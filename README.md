# What This Script Can Do

This PowerShell script is a comprehensive Windows system optimization tool. It automates various tasks to improve system performance, clean up unnecessary files, and optimize disk usage. Below is a detailed list of its functionalities:

---

## 1. Task Automation  
- Creates a **Task Scheduler** entry to run the script **daily at 12:01 AM**.  
- Ensures consistent system maintenance without user intervention.  

---

## 2. System Information Display  
- Displays key system information, such as:  
  - Operating System details.  
  - System architecture (e.g., x64 or x86).  
  - Total RAM, CPU usage, and more.  

---

## 3. Junk File Cleanup  
- Removes unnecessary files to free up disk space:  
  - Clears the `%temp%` folder.  
  - Deletes error reports (`WER` files).  
  - Removes thumbnail caches.  
  - Cleans Windows Update temporary files.  

---

## 4. Disk Optimization  
- **For SSDs:**  
  - Runs the **TRIM** command for better performance and longer lifespan.  
- **For HDDs:**  
  - Defragments the disk to optimize file storage.  
- Compresses specific folders using **NTFS compression** to save disk space.  

---

## 5. Service Management  
- Disables unnecessary Windows services to improve performance:  
  - Diagnostic Tracking Service (`DiagTrack`).  
  - Windows Search (`WSearch`).  
  - Superfetch/Prefetch (`SysMain`).  
- Tweaks Xbox-related features by disabling **GameDVR** and other registry entries.  

---

## 6. System Performance Enhancements  
- Optimizes network performance by modifying **TCP settings** (e.g., autotuning).  
- Adjusts Windows settings to reduce background processes.  

---

## 7. Logging and Error Handling  
- Logs script actions to track what changes were made.  
- Implements **error-handling** mechanisms to ensure the script continues running if one section encounters an error.  

---

## 8. Safe Execution  
- Checks for **administrator privileges** before running.  
- Skips operations that could harm the system if run without elevated permissions.  

---

## Who Should Use This Script?  
This script is ideal for:  
- **Tech-savvy users** who want to automate system maintenance.  
- **System administrators** looking for a customizable optimization tool.  
- **Gamers and power users** who want to maximize system performance.
